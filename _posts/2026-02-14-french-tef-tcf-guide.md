# Stuck at 440 CRS? You need French.

If you are applying for Canada PR (Express Entry) in 2026, you know the pain. The cutoff scores are high (often 480+).
Even with a Masters degree and 3 years of experience, you might fall short.

**Enter the "Golden Ticket": French.**
Canada is desperate for Francophones outside Quebec.

  If you score <strong>CLB 7</strong> in all 4 French skills, your CRS score jumps instantly.

## 🇫🇷 Which Exam? TEF vs TCF vs DELF

This is where 90% of Indians get confused.
* **DELF/DALF:** This is for *Academic* purposes (Studying in France). **Do NOT take this for Canada PR.**
* **TEF Canada:** Test d’Évaluation de Français.
* **TCF Canada:** Test de Connaissance du Français.

**Both TEF and TCF are accepted for Canada PR.** They are like Pepsi and Coke—very similar, just different brands.

### The Comparison: TEF vs TCF

| Feature | **TEF Canada** | **TCF Canada** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Difficulty** | Slightly harder Reading section | Slightly harder Listening section |
| **Format** | MCQs have negative marking (sometimes) | No negative marking |
| **Listening** | Long radio interviews | Short, fast dialogues |
| **Speaking** | Roleplay (Argument/Persuasion) | 3 Tasks (Interview, Explanation, Opinion) |
| **Fee (India)** | ~₹25,000 | ~₹24,000 |

## 🎯 What is the "Magic Number" (CLB 7)?

To get the 50 bonus points, you need **NCLC 7 (CLB 7)**.
Here is what that looks like in raw scores:

* **Listening:** 249-279 (TEF) / 458-502 (TCF)
* **Reading:** 207-232 (TEF) / 453-498 (TCF)
* **Writing:** 310-348 (TEF) / 10-11 (TCF)
* **Speaking:** 310-348 (TEF) / 10-11 (TCF)

**Can a beginner do it?**
Yes. If you start from Zero (A1), it takes about **8-10 months** of dedicated study (10 hours/week) to reach B2 (which is roughly CLB 7).

## ⚠️ The "Quebec" Trap

Be careful when booking your exam slot!
There are different versions of these exams:
1.  **TEF Canada:** Valid for Federal PR (Express Entry). **(BOOK THIS ONE)**
2.  **TEF Quebec (TEFAQ):** Valid *only* for Quebec immigration.
3.  **TEF Naturalisation:** Valid for French citizenship.

<div class="alert-box">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Ensure your booking confirmation says <strong>"TEF CANADA"</strong> or <strong>"TCF CANADA"</strong>. The other versions will be rejected by IRCC.
</div>

## 🏁 Final Verdict: Which one should YOU take?

* **Take TEF if:** You are good at reading long texts and arguing points logically (good for Lawyers/MBA grads).
* **Take TCF if:** You prefer straightforward questions and are worried about negative marking.

**Need a French Tutor?**
We have partnered with certified TEF trainers who have helped 500+ Indians get their PR.
