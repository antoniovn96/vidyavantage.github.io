# Germany vs UK
**The Battle of Tuition vs Time.**

If you are an Indian engineer, this is the biggest question.
* **Germany:** Tuition is FREE (mostly). But you need to learn German (B1 level recommended) and the course takes 2 years.
* **UK:** Course is only 1 year (saves time). But tuition is ₹20L+.

**The VidyaVantage Verdict:**
If you have budget constraints, pick Germany. If you want to enter the job market quickly, pick the UK.
