# The "Coaching Mafia" Myth.

Every year, Indian students spend crores on IELTS coaching.
**Here is the truth:** IELTS is not a test of your *intelligence* (like JEE). It is a test of your *familiarity* with English.

If you watch Netflix without subtitles and can write a decent email, you can score Band 8 **on your own**. You just need a strategy.

## 💰 The Logistics (2026 Update)

First, let's look at the wallet damage.

* **Exam Fee (India):** ₹17,000 (Approx)
* **Conducted By:** IDP Australia (British Council no longer conducts it in India).
* **Validity:** 2 Years.
* **Format:** Computer-delivered (Result in 3-5 days) OR Paper-based (Result in 13 days).

<div class="tip-box">
  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Choose the <strong>Computer-delivered</strong> test. Typing is faster than writing, and editing your essay is much easier!

## 🎯 Academic vs. General Training: Which one?

Don't book the wrong exam!

| Feature | **IELTS Academic** | **IELTS General Training** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Who is it for?** | Students (Undergrad/Masters) | Working Professionals (PR Visa) |
| **Reading Section** | Long, complex academic passages | Short texts, ads, notices |
| **Writing Task 1** | Describe a Graph/Chart | Write a Letter (Formal/Informal) |
| **Difficulty** | High | Medium |

## 🚀 The 4-Week Battle Plan (Module by Module)

To get an overall Band 8, you need to master all 4 sections.

<div class="module-grid">

  <div class="module-card">
    <span class="band-score">👂 Listening</span>
    <p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Losing focus for 5 seconds misses 3 answers.</p>
    <p><strong>The Hack:</strong> Read the questions *before* the audio starts. Predict the answers (e.g., "This blank needs a Number").</p>
  </div>

  <div class="module-card">
    <span class="band-score">📖 Reading</span>
    <p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Reading the whole passage.</p>
    <p><strong>The Hack:</strong> Skim & Scan. Read the first and last sentence of every paragraph to get the "Gist".</p>
  </div>

  <div class="module-card">
    <span class="band-score">✍️ Writing</span>
    <p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Using fancy vocabulary incorrectly.</p>
    <p><strong>The Hack:</strong> Structure is King. Use the 4-paragraph structure: Intro -> Body 1 -> Body 2 -> Conclusion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="module-card">
    <span class="band-score">🗣️ Speaking</span>
    <p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Trying to fake a British/American accent.</p>
    <p><strong>The Hack:</strong> Be natural. Speak fluently. If you make a mistake, correct it and move on. Don't pause.</p>
  </div>

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes that Kill Your Score



1.  **Leaving blanks empty:** There is NO negative marking in IELTS. Guess if you don't know!
2.  **Writing too little:** If Task 2 asks for 250 words, writing 240 will lower your score penalty. Aim for 260-280.
3.  **Memorizing answers:** Examiners are trained to spot "scripted" answers in the Speaking test.

<div class="warning-box">
  <strong>Reality Check:</strong> Most top universities (Oxford, Ivy League) require a minimum <strong>Band 7.5 overall</strong> with no band less than 7.0.
</div>
