<h2 id="intro">Stop Googling "Fulbright"</h2>

<p>Everyone applies for the Fulbright or Chevening. The competition is insane (0.1% acceptance rate).</p>
<p>But did you know there are massive <strong>Indian Trust Funds</strong> that specifically want to fund <em>Indian</em> students? They don't advertise heavily, so the competition is lower.</p>
<p>Here are the top 4 "Hidden Gems" for 2026.</p>
