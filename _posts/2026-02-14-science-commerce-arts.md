# The Myth of "Scope"

Parents say "Science has scope." But did you know a **Corporate Lawyer (Arts stream)** earns more than an average **IT Engineer** in Bangalore today?

Don't choose based on salary. Choose based on your "Pain Tolerance."
* Can you tolerate 12 hours of math? -> Science.
* Can you tolerate reading 500 pages of case law? -> Arts/Law.
