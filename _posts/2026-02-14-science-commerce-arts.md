# The Myth of "Scope"

Parents say "Science has scope." But did you know a **Corporate Lawyer (Arts stream)** often earns more than an average **IT Engineer** in Bangalore today?

In 2026, "Scope" is not about the stream. It is about **Excellence**. An excellent Graphic Designer makes more money than an average Doctor.

## The "Pain Tolerance" Test

Don't ask "What do I love?" (Everyone loves Netflix).
Ask **"What pain can I tolerate for 5 years?"**

Read these 3 scenarios. Which one sounds *bearable* to you?

### 🧪 Scenario A: The Science Grind
"I am okay with studying 6-8 hours a day. I can handle the frustration of solving a Physics problem that takes 3 pages of calculation. I don't mind sacrificing my weekends for coaching classes."
* **Verdict:** You are built for **Science (PCM/PCMB)**.

### 📊 Scenario B: The Money Game
"I hate long theories, but I love logic. I want to understand how money works, how businesses grow, and how the stock market moves. I prefer practical problems over abstract physics."
* **Verdict:** You are built for **Commerce**.

### 🎨 Scenario C: The Human Connection
"I hate formulas. I love reading stories, debating ideas, understanding history, or designing things. I am observant and good with words or visuals."
* **Verdict:** You are built for **Arts / Humanities**.
