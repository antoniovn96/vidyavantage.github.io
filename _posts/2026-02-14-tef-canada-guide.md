# The "Secret" Update that is failing students.

If you are reading old blogs from 2023, you are preparing for the wrong exam.
**In 2026, the TEF Canada is harder.**

Previously, in the *Compréhension Orale* (Listening) section, you heard the audio twice.
**Now, the audio is played ONLY ONCE.**

This means if you sneeze, you miss the answer.
Here is how to survive the new TEF and grab those **50 Bonus Points** for Canada PR.

</div>

## 🎯 The "Magic Numbers" (CLB 7)

To get the 50 extra points in Express Entry, you need **NCLC 7** (CLB 7) in *all four* sections. If you get CLB 9 in three sections but CLB 6 in one, you get **ZERO** bonus points.

Here are the exact scores you need to hit:

<div class="score-grid">
  <div class="score-card">
    <span>📖 Reading</span>
    <span class="score-num">207-232</span>
    <small>out of 300</small>
  </div>

  <div class="score-card">
    <span>👂 Listening</span>
    <span class="score-num">249-279</span>
    <small>out of 360</small>
  </div>

  <div class="score-card">
    <span>✍️ Writing</span>
    <span class="score-num">310-348</span>
    <small>out of 450</small>
  </div>

  <div class="score-card">
    <span>🗣️ Speaking</span>
    <span class="score-num">310-348</span>
    <small>out of 450</small>
  </div>

## 🚨 The "Audio Once" Crisis

<div class="update-box">
  <h3>⚠️ 2026 FORMAT ALERT</h3>
  <p><strong>The Listening Section is now brutal.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You listen to radio clips, interviews, and public announcements.</li>
    <li>The audio plays <strong>once</strong>.</li>
    <li>The questions are often "implied" (not direct).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> You must read the questions <em>before</em> the audio starts. If you are reading the question while the audio is playing, you have already lost.</p>
</div>

## 🥊 TEF vs TCF: The New Verdict

Since TEF made Listening harder, many students are switching to **TCF Canada**.

* **Choose TEF if:** You are a fast reader. The Reading section is still reasonable.
* **Choose TCF if:** You panic easily. TCF questions are generally more direct, though the exam format is slightly different.

**My Advice:** Take a mock test for BOTH before booking.

## 📅 Realistic Timeline (From Zero)

Can you learn French in 6 months? **No.**
Unless you study 6 hours a day.

* **A1 (Beginner):** 2 Months
* **A2 (Elementary):** 2 Months
* **B1 (Intermediate):** 3 Months
* **B2 (Upper Interm / CLB 7):** 3 Months
* **Total:** **10-12 Months** of consistent weekend classes.

**Don't wait.** If you start today, you will have your PR by next year.
