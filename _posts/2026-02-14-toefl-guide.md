# The "Marathon" is Over.

For years, students hated the TOEFL because it was a 3-hour torture session.
**Good News:** In 2026, the TOEFL iBT is now **less than 2 hours**. It is officially the shortest English proficiency test.

If you have a short attention span, the TOEFL might now be better for you than the IELTS.

## 🇺🇸 Why take TOEFL over IELTS?

While IELTS is King in the UK/Canada, **TOEFL is God in the USA.**
9 out of 10 US universities prefer it. Why? Because it tests *Academic English* exclusively. It prepares you for the rigorous lecture halls of Harvard and Stanford.

### The Great Debate: TOEFL vs. IELTS

| Feature | **TOEFL iBT** | **IELTS Academic** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accent** | North American (mostly) | British / Australian / Mixed |
| **Speaking** | Speak to a **Microphone** | Speak to a **Human** |
| **Format** | 100% Multiple Choice (mostly) | Mix of blanks, matching, MCQs |
| **Duration** | < 2 Hours (Fast!) | ~2 Hours 45 Mins |

## 📉 The New Format (2026 Update)

ETS (the creator) has removed all the "filler" questions.

1.  **Reading (35 mins):** Only 2 passages now. Fast-paced.
2.  **Listening (36 mins):** 3 Lectures, 2 Conversations.
3.  **Speaking (16 mins):** 4 Tasks. You speak to a screen.
4.  **Writing (29 mins):** **MAJOR CHANGE HERE.**

<div class="new-feature">
  <strong>🚨 NEW TASK ALERT: "Writing for an Academic Discussion"</strong>
  <br><br>
  The old "Independent Essay" is GONE.
  <br>
  Now, you must read a professor's question and two student responses, then write your own contribution in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. It mimics a real online college forum.
</div>

## 🎯 The Magic Number: 100

TOEFL is scored out of **120** (30 per section).

<div class="score-box">
  <span class="score-big">100+</span>
  The "Safe Score" for Top 50 US Universities.
</div>

* **MIT / Stanford:** Usually require 100+ (with 25+ in each section).
* **State Universities:** Usually accept 80+.
* **Community Colleges:** Usually accept 60+.

## 💡 How to Hack the "Speaking" Section

The Speaking section is where Indians lose the most marks. Not because of accent, but because of **"Umm... Ahh..."**

The computer grader hates silence.
* **Strategy:** Use templates.
* *Example:* "I believe the professor's argument is valid for two reasons. First, he mentions [Point 1]. Second, he explains [Point 2]."

**Don't try to be creative.** Be robotic, clear, and loud.

## 🏁 Final Verdict

If you are:
1.  Targeting the **USA exclusively**.
2.  Comfortable **typing fast** (QWERTY keyboard).
3.  Prefer talking to a **screen** rather than a human face.

Then **TOEFL is your winner.**
